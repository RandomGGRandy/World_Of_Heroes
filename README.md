# Pathfinding Previews;
I've been working on creating an A* pathfinding system inspired by the game 'Gladius (2003)'. It's been a long process since I first started. although it still has some adjustments, it's turning out pretty well by far. I want to show off 2 pictures that are result of what I have by far;

After some time after creating the A* pathfinding system, I created a simple function that chooses random cell indexes to set the cell type to 'None', which in other words is untraversable cells. This way, we can test the A* pathfinding to make sure that it actually does avoid cells that can be traversed as seen below
